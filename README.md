# dotfiles
Dotfiles are common configuration files used by editors, shells, and many other
applications. These are *my* dotfiles. Please feel free to copy and share!

# Installing

The main install is simple:
```
./install.sh
```

To install the Python packages, run:
```
sudo python/install.sh
```

# What all is in here anyways?

My dotfiles include my personal configs for:

- Editors: Atom & vim
- Shells: bash
- Languages: Python
- Tools: gpg

# Contributions welcome!
